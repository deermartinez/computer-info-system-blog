            <h3>In your own words, what is a network.</h3>
            <p>A network is the connection between two or some systems-sharing information. </p>
            <h3>What is the difference between the web and the network</h3>
            <p>The internet is the network the web is housed in-like a subunit. The internet is the connection while the
                web is the content. </p>
            <h3>The internet is not a physical place or chip, so how do you explain it?</h3>
            <p>The internet is the network/s connecting the world. </p>
            <h3>How is ISP related to the internet</h3>
            <p>Your ISP address is your footprint on the internet. </p>
            <h3>Why was the internet created, when?</h3>
            <p>The internet was created for military purposes? I assume for better communication.</p>
            <h3>What is DNS and why</h3>
            <p>Used to apply specific names and addresses to websites</p>
            <h3>How has the internet expanded in the last 10 years in relation to computers. </h3>
            <p>Computers and the internet have both expanded in terms of development and capability. While our computer
                have gotten better, so has the capacity of our internet.</p>
