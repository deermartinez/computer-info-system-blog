            <h3> What are 3 dangerous computer threats to you?</h3>
            <p>Here are a few cyber threats that would threaten my work of life the most.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Phishing</strong>-Phishing is sending a fraudulent email from what you usually believe are trustworthy sources.
                They are here looking for any personal information they get get to either explot or take advantage of
                you. This makes it into my list because while I usually don't fall for these types of things, that might
                chance when I am taking care of my grandmother or when I myself am old. They are only going to get more
                convincing as time goes on, and it's also easy to reveal information that is important without realizing
                it.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Malware</strong>-Malware is a big threat no matter who you are. Malware doesn't exactly steal your information(it
                can techinically) but instead takes a nice, long, and harmful rest in your computer system. It disrupts
                and can even damage functions and is overall just a nuisance.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Denial of service</strong>-A DOS attack is kind of exactly what is sounds like. You aren't able to access what
                you need to on your network or system. I am only a lowly student currently but I imagine if I was a
                small business or had important information on my computer, a DOS attack would put me in a lot worse
                position.

            <h3>How is the trend of digital convergence seen in the market?
            </h3>
            <p>Digital convergence has brought us single devices with the capabilities that used to require four or five
                separate tools. An example of technology convergence is a smartphone, which combines the functions of a
                telephone, camera, music player, and a digital personal assistant like google or Siri, all in one
                device. Phones, computers, tablets, ect.
                In a smartphone we can do all sorts of things, you can play a game, watch a movie without needing a DvD
                player, listen to music without needing a cassette. Technology has improved a lot over the years and it
                sure has a more advanced future. All basic things now have improvements that make them better than their
                old selves.
                In business itâ€™s not different, companies spend lots of money on equipment that will allow them to have
                things done faster and easier, for example for video meetings, digital documents, and communication with
                other companies. </p>
            <h3>What hardware and software comprise a typical smartphone?</h3>
            <p>Moving all the components from a computer and what makes it function best is going to be harder to make
                on a smaller device, so you need the essentials.

                Some external hardware of a phone is going to include 
                <ul>
                    <li>display ( your touch screen)</li>
                    <li>microphone</li>
                    <li>speaker</li>
                    <li>(Charging and audio port)</li>
                </ul>
               
                Internal hardware in a phone is going to mainly have:
                <ul>
                    <li>SIM card-they hold out information and allow network connection
                battery for power/connection to charge
                memory unit(Low powerRAM)</li>
                <li>Camera</li>
                <li>ON/OFF switch</li>
                <li>luetooth/GPS features</li>
                <li>Computers need a cpu of course, so for phones they put the CPU and all its supporters on a chip called
                SoC-System on a chip.</li>
                <li>GPU-(Graphics Processing Unit)Depending on the phone you get will also change the overall
                graphics/definition of it</li>
                </ul>
   
                As for software(how the phone is going to function/run), the two most common Operating Systems in a
                phone are going to be IOS or Android.
                (You might also be familiar with Windows or Blackberry. )

            <h2> Want some Advice?</h2>
            <i>Bolded words are important comparison components of the two computers if you just want the information.</i>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Don't know what you should choose between the Surface Pro 6 and the Lenova FLex 11?
                Well, I'm here to take a little bit of a closer look at them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I really understand the value of money right now being a broke college student-what I spend has to
                matter and hold itself up for as long as possible. And <i>as</i> a student, I need a computer that has a
                good memory, processor and storage. If it has good graphics-great! I'm not always a student, so when I
                have time to relax why not watch a movie or show? 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                To not overcomplicate it, the Microsoft Surface Pro has a better <strong>CPU</strong>-which is responsible for the
                overall speed of the laptop. The stronger the CPU the quicker you open and access your applications. As
                for <strong>memory</strong>, the Surface Pro 6 has twice the gb of RAM than the Lenova does. The Surface Pro also has a
                better <strong>Graphics</strong> card that the Flex at Intel HD Graphics 620 vs Intel UHD 605.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, overall so far the Surface is coming on top. Now to start looking at prices!
            <h4>Microsoft Surface Pro 6: 609.00 vs. Lenova Flex 11: 500.00</h4>
            The Flex is 100.0 cheaper, but the Surface has come on top otherwise.
        <br>
        As a student, I think for the simple comparisons made here I would need to chose the Surface Pro 6. It is a little more expnsive, but the differences in the speed and memory are well worth it. I know I need to store a lot and access a lot more, so it's todays winner.

            <h3>In your own words, what is a network.</h3>
            <p>A network is the connection between two or some systems-sharing information. </p>
            <h3>What is the difference between the web and the network</h3>
            <p>The internet is the network the web is housed in-like a subunit. The internet is the connection while the
                web is the content. </p>
            <h3>The internet is not a physical place or chip, so how do you explain it?</h3>
            <p>The internet is the network/s connecting the world. </p>
            <h3>How is ISP related to the internet</h3>
            <p>Your ISP address is your footprint on the internet. </p>
            <h3>Why was the internet created, when?</h3>
            <p>The internet was created for military purposes? I assume for better communication.</p>
            <h3>What is DNS and why</h3>
            <p>Used to apply specific names and addresses to websites</p>
            <h3>How has the internet expanded in the last 10 years in relation to computers. </h3>
            <p>Computers and the internet have both expanded in terms of development and capability. While our computer
                have gotten better, so has the capacity of our internet.</p>
