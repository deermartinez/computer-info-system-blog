            <h2> Want some Advice?</h2>
            <p>Don't know what you should choose between the Surface Pro 6 and the Lenova FLex 11?
                Well, I'm here to take a little bit of a closer look at them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I really understand the value of money right now being a broke college student-what I spend has to
                matter and hold itself up for as long as possible. And <i>as</i> a student, I need a computer that has a
                good memory, processor and storage. If it has good graphics-great! I'm not always a student, so when I
                have time to relax why not watch a movie or show?
                <br>
                <br>
                To not overcomplicate it, the Microsoft Surface Pro has a better CPU-which is responsible for the
                overall speed of the laptop. The stronger the CPU the quicker you open and access your applications. As
                for memory, the Surface Pro 6 has twice the gb of RAM than the Lenova does. The Surface Pro also has a
                better Graphics card that the Flex at Intel HD Graphics 620 vs Intel UHD 605.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, overall so far the Surface is coming on top. Now to start looking at prices!
            <h4>Microsoft Surface Pro 6: 609.00 vs. Lenova Flex 11: 500.00</h4>
            The Flex is 100.0 cheaper, but the Surface has comeon top otherwise </p>

            <h5><i>That are really simple because I was told to</i></h5>

            <h3>In your own words, what is a network.</h3>
            <p>A network is the connection between two or some systems-sharing information. </p>
            <h3>What is the difference between the web and the network</h3>
            <p>The internet is the network the web is housed in-like a subunit. The internet is the connection while the
                web is the content. </p>
            <h3>The internet is not a physical place or chip, so how do you explain it?</h3>
            <p>The internet is the network/s connecting the world. </p>
            <h3>How is ISP related to the internet</h3>
            <p>Your ISP address is your footprint on the internet. </p>
            <h3>Why was the internet created, when?</h3>
            <p>The internet was created for military purposes? I assume for better communication.</p>
            <h3>What is DNS and why</h3>
            <p>Used to apply specific names and addresses to websites</p>
            <h3>How has the internet expanded in the last 10 years in relation to computers. </h3>
            <p>Computers and the internet have both expanded in terms of development and capability. While our computer
                have gotten better, so has the capacity of our internet.</p>
